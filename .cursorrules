# Project Laws

## Requirements
- The broad project requirements are in docs/specs/requirements.md - refer to this document when making plans. If a request is incompatible with one of the requirements, do not perform any actions until you have notified me and sought input.

## Postgres Only
Use PostgreSQL 16+ features (JSONB, TSVector, FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED). Never use SQLite.

## Test-Driven
- Every feature implementation MUST be accompanied by a pytest file using testcontainers-python.

- **Migration Verification:** Every time an Alembic migration is generated, a corresponding test in `tests/test_migrations.py` must be updated/added. 
- This test must:
  1. Use `testcontainers` to start a fresh Postgres instance.
  2. Run `alembic upgrade head` to verify the migration script is syntactically correct and respects Postgres 16 constraints.
  3. Run `alembic downgrade base` (or -1) to ensure the migration is reversible.

## Repository Pattern
Database access must be abstracted into Repository classes. No ORM calls in business logic.

## BaseWorker Hook
All workers must inherit from BaseWorker and implement handle_signal(command).

## Environment
The development environment is using uv so any time a command is given that requires uv (whether executed by you or displayed for me), ensure that the full uv command is shown.
