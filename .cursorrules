# Project Laws

## Postgres Only
Use PostgreSQL 16+ features (JSONB, TSVector, FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED). Never use SQLite.

## Test-Driven
Every feature implementation MUST be accompanied by a pytest file using testcontainers-python.

## Repository Pattern
Database access must be abstracted into Repository classes. No ORM calls in business logic.

## BaseWorker Hook
All workers must inherit from BaseWorker and implement handle_signal(command).

## Environment
The development environment is using uv so any time a command is given that requires uv (whether executed by you or displayed for me), ensure that the full uv command is shown.
